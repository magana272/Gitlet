Inital thoughts: 
    - This reminds me sort of REST: sort of a MVC type of project 
        - The View: What is your request? Is there response to the request 
        - The Controller: How are we updateing the command? 
        -The Model: This is our data structures. The blobs, commits, and trees.
I've broken this down into three parts:
 1) What is the input?
 2) The respective contollers will handle the creation of the Data Structs 
 3) What needs to be in the data structure?
