Commit tree:
    initcommit --> 
    initcommit <- commit1[Head]
    initcommit <- commit1 <-- commit2[Head]
    initcommit <- commit1 <- commit2 <-commmit3 [Head]

    1) each commit must have a refrence to prev commit 
    2) The commit tree has a hashmap with branch name and branch name
    3) A branch does need to know about other branches... just the previouse commit

    5) Each commit has a list of blobs.

Commit:
